/**
 * End-to-end smoke test for the outer app-shell navigation graph.
 *
 * Catches the bug class where someone deletes / renames / mis-wires a route in
 * `:cmp-navigation` without a compile-time signal. The test exercises the
 * template-shell outer routes only — fork feature destinations live in
 * `:cmp-shared/.../MifosNavHost.kt` and are covered by fork-side tests.
 *
 * Phase 2 nav-chunk (skeleton): the template-demo route universe
 * (`kpt.feature.{bills,calculators,crypto,currencyrates,emicalculator,loans,
 * macro,rates}.*`) that the original template smoke-test iterated over was
 * stripped — those modules don't exist in the fork's classpath. The test now
 * covers the three template outer routes that survived the demo-strip. As
 * per-feature typed-route conversion progresses (see TODOs in
 * `authenticated/AuthenticatedNavigation.kt`), each converted route gets added
 * to the [parameterlessRoutes] list below.
