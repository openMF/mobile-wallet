/**
 * Resolve a secret's on-disk path for the Gradle build by READING the resolver-generated map
 * `gradle/secrets-paths.properties` — NEVER by shelling out.
 *
 * `deployment/_shared/lib/build_secrets.rb` (the one resolver over `secrets/LAYOUT.yaml`, SoT) stays the
 * single algorithm; its `export-paths` command emits `key=<repo-relative-path>` for every file-like secret
 * (`live`-wins-else-`sample`). That map is generated OUTSIDE Gradle — by the CI `pre_fastlane_script` /
 * Fastlane pre-step / `/secrets pull`, all of which run before the build and have Ruby — and Gradle merely
 * looks a key up in it. This is deliberate: a config-time subprocess (the old `build-secrets path <key>`
 * exec) is Windows-shebang-fragile, hostile to the configuration cache, and runs on EVERY build including
 * the Desktop/Web checks that never sign Android. A file read via [org.gradle.api.provider.ProviderFactory.fileContents]
 * is cross-platform, config-cache-correct, and free.
 *
 * Still NOT a parallel resolver (RULE-SECRETS-LAYOUT-001 / check-secrets-resolver.sh SR-7/SR-12): Gradle
 * never parses `secrets/LAYOUT.yaml` and never hardcodes a `secrets/live/…` path — it only consumes the
 * resolver's own output. When the map is absent (e.g. a PR-check build that never materializes secrets) or
 * lacks the key, it returns an under-`build/` sentinel so configuration of a non-signing build always
 * succeeds; a real Android release-signing task supplies the keystore via the `KEYSTORE_PATH` env override
 * (see cmp-android signingConfigs), so it never depends on this fallback. Returns an absolute [File].
