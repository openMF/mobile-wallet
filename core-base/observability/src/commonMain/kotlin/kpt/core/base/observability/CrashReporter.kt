package kpt.core.base.observability

/**
 * Fork-customization seam for crash + non-fatal-error reporting.
 *
 * The toolkit ships [ConsoleCrashReporter] which writes everything to stdout — sufficient
 * for local development but not for shipped builds. Forks override the
 * [kpt.core.base.observability.di.observabilityModule] binding in their app module
 * with a real implementation (Firebase Crashlytics, Sentry, Bugsnag, Datadog RUM, etc.).
 *
 * ## Why a separate seam from the cmp-firebase `AnalyticsHelper`?
 *
 * Crash reporting and analytics serve different audiences:
 * - **Analytics** is high-volume, sampled, event-stream (button clicks, screen views) routed
 *   to product owners.
 * - **Crash reporting** is low-volume, exception-detail-heavy, stack-trace-bearing data
 *   routed to engineering.
 *
 * Most production stacks (Firebase Analytics + Firebase Crashlytics, Mixpanel + Sentry)
 * keep them in separate SDKs with separate ingestion pipelines and different retention
 * policies. Modeling them as separate seams matches the wire reality and lets each fork
 * choose providers independently.
 *
 * ## Contract notes
 *
 * - All methods **must** be safe to call from any thread / coroutine. No suspending APIs —
 *   crash reporters typically queue + flush asynchronously.
 * - [setUser] accepts a nullable userId for sign-out flows; pass `null` to clear.
 * - [recordException] is for **caught** exceptions (e.g. retry-loop exhaustion); uncaught
 *   exceptions are reported by the platform-level handler the fork installs.
 * - [isConfigured] is `false` for the no-op default; UI / startup checks can decide whether
 *   to surface "send crash logs?" prompts based on this.
 *
 * @see ConsoleCrashReporter Default development-only implementation

 * - Sentry: `SentryLevel.DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR/FATAL`
 * - Bugsnag: severity field on the event payload
 *
 * The toolkit reserves [Fatal] for events that **would** be crashes if the code path
 * didn't catch them (e.g. a guard at the root of a coroutine scope catching CancellationException).
