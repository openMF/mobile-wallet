/**
 * Test double for [ScreenDataStream]. Emits [ScreenState] programmatically.
 *
 * Use in ViewModel unit tests to control state sequences without a real Store or network:
 * ```kotlin
 * val fakeStream = FakeScreenDataStream<ClientDetail>()
 * val vm = EditClientViewModel(stream = fakeStream.asStream, ...)
 *
 * fakeStream.emit(ScreenState.Loading)
 * fakeStream.emit(ScreenState.Content(client))
 * ```
 *
 * **Combined-VM fixture pattern** for ScreenDataStream + SubmitHandler tests:
 * 1. Submit blocked while Loading: emit Loading, call vm.onSave() → SubmitState stays Idle.
 * 2. Background refresh during Submitting: emit Content, trigger submit, emit second Content —
 *    SubmitState should stay Submitting (submit wins the race).
 * 3. `submitWhenContent` fires only after Content arrives: emit Loading, then Content —
 *    verify submit executes only once Content is present.
