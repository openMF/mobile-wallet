 *
 * UI maps `band` to a per-card freshness indicator (icon + tooltip); the surrounding
 * `lastSyncedAt` / `ttl` / `lastError` fields are exposed so tooltips can humanize the
 * age and categorize the error message.
 *
 * Construction is normally indirect via [kpt.core.base.store.infra.DecisionEngine.decideFreshness]
 * or the sibling Flow on `ScreenDataStream`. Tests + initial StateFlow values use [initial].
