package kpt.core.base.store.push

/**
 * Server-originated push notification that mutates a [org.mobilenativefoundation.store.store5.MutableStore].
 *
 * The three variants map 1:1 to typical CRUD push payloads from a backend over
 * WebSocket / SSE / FCM data-message channels:
 *
 * - [Insert] — a new entity arrived; the local cache should add it.
 * - [Update] — an existing entity was modified server-side; the local cache should reflect
 *   the new value. (Merge vs. replace is determined by [PushMergeStrategy].)
 * - [Delete] — an entity was removed server-side; the local cache should evict it.
 *
 * Consumers wrap their transport (WebSocket frame parser, SSE event handler, FCM data
 * payload decoder) in a `Flow<PushEvent<K, V>>` and feed it to a [PushStoreAdapter].
 *
 * @param K Store key type (e.g. account id, transaction id).
 * @param V Store value type (the domain model already mapped from the wire payload).
