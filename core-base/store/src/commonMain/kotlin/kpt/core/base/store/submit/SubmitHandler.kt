/**
 * Reusable one-shot executor for a single form/action submission lifecycle.
 *
 * Unlike [ScreenDataStream] (continuous Flow wrapper), [SubmitHandler] is a single-execution
 * executor: each [submit] call performs one API call and transitions [state] to a terminal state.
 *
 * **ViewModel usage:**
 * ```kotlin
 * private val submit = viewModelScope.submitHandler<ClientId>()
 * val submitState    = submit.state
 *     .stateIn(viewModelScope, SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(5000), SubmitState.Idle)
 *
 * fun onSave(form: ClientForm) = submit.submit { repository.createClient(form) }
 * fun onRetry()               = submit.retry()
 * fun onDismiss()             = submit.reset()
 * ```
 *
 * **Screen usage:**
 * ```kotlin
 * Box(Modifier.fillMaxSize()) {
 *     FormContent(enabled = !submitState.isSubmitting, onSubmit = { viewModel.onSave(it) })
 *     SubmitProgressOverlay(visible = submitState.isSubmitting)
 *     SubmitResultHandler(
 *         state = submitState,
 *         onSubmitted = { onNavigateBack() },
 *         onFailed = { error, category -> viewModel.onDismiss(); showError(error, category) },
 *     )
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Create via [submitHandler] extension on [CoroutineScope].
