/**
 * [ScreenContent] wrapped in a Material 3 [PullToRefreshBox] — a self-contained pull-to-refresh
 * screen for the common case where a screen owns its own refresh gesture rather than delegating
 * to the app-level `KptScaffold` / `KptPullToRefreshState`.
 *
 * Closes the doc↔source gap in the `CORE_STORE.md` wrapper table (the pull-to-refresh row) with a
 * concrete, dual-input (Store5-optional, D2) composable: it accepts BOTH a live [ScreenDataStream]
 * (the stream overload) AND a plain [ScreenState] value (the value overload), so a static screen
 * passes a value now and upgrades to a Store5 stream later with ZERO call-site change.
 *
 * The refreshing spinner is driven by the content's [FreshnessSignal.isRefreshing] — when the
 * Store5 stream reports an in-flight refresh, the M3 indicator shows automatically. `onRefresh`
 * is invoked when the user pulls; the stream overload defaults it to `stream.refresh()`.
 *
 * For infinite-scroll paginated lists prefer `PagingScreenContent` (it coordinates load-more with
 * refresh); for dashboards whose refresh is owned by `KptScaffold`, keep the app-level gesture and
 * use plain `ScreenContent`. This wrapper is for a single-source screen that owns its own refresh.

 * `stream.refresh()`. Mirrors [ScreenContent]'s stream overload.

 * RefreshableScreenContent(stream = viewModel.rates) { rates, _ -> RatesList(rates) }
