/**
 * Fade-through enter/exit factories. Use for **sibling navigation** —
 * bottom-nav tab switches, settings section switches, paged tabs. The outgoing
 * surface fades to nothing before the incoming surface fades in, so there's
 * no overlap of two competing UIs.
 *
 * Two API surfaces (same as [KptSharedAxis]): `@Composable` no-arg variants for
 * `@Composable` scopes, and `fun(motion: Motion)` variants for non-Composable lambdas
 * (provider definitions).
 *
 * Sequence: exit fades to 0 over `durationShort4`, then enter fades to 1
 * over `durationMedium2` after a `durationShort4` delay.
