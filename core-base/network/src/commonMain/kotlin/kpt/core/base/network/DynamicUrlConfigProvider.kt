/**
 * Interface for providing dynamic URL configuration at runtime.
 *
 * Implementations of this interface allow the HTTP client to dynamically
 * switch between different server endpoints without recreating the client.
 *
 * This is useful for:
 * - Multi-tenant applications where users can switch between servers
 * - Development/staging/production environment switching
 * - White-label apps with different backend endpoints
 *
 * Example implementation:
 * ```kotlin
 * class MyConfigProvider(
 *     private val preferencesRepository: UserPreferencesRepository
 * ) : DynamicUrlConfigProvider {
 *     override fun getBaseUrl(): String = preferencesRepository.selectedServer.value?.url
 *         ?: "https://default.api.com"
 *
 *     override fun getLoggableHosts(): List<String> = listOf(
 *         preferencesRepository.selectedServer.value?.host ?: "default.api.com"
 *     )
 * }
 * ```
 */
interface DynamicUrlConfigProvider {
    /**
     * Returns the current base URL to use for API requests.
     * This is called for each request, allowing runtime URL switching.
     */

    /**
     * Returns the list of hostnames that should have HTTP logging enabled.
     * This is called dynamically, allowing the logging filter to adapt
     * to the currently selected server.

/**
 * Open, extensible identifier for a named API endpoint.
 *
 * This is deliberately **not** a closed enum: `core-base` ships only the generic [MAIN] default,
 * and each project defines its own endpoint names at the `core/` level with vocabulary that fits
 * its domain — e.g. `PRODUCTION`, `STAGING`, `SERVER1`, `PAYMENT_GATEWAY`. See the `AppUrlTypes`
 * example in `core/network`.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * // in core/ (your project) — name them however you like, add as many as you need
 * object AppUrlTypes {
 *     val MAIN    = UrlType.MAIN
 *     val SERVER1 = UrlType("SERVER1")
 *     val STAGING = UrlType("STAGING")
 * }
