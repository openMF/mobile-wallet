/**
 * Durable row for a form payload that failed to reach the server.
 *
 * Written by [kpt.core.data.store.RoomSubmitOutbox] when a network error occurs during
 * form submission. The row survives process death so the user can resume or retry later.
 *
 * @param id          Auto-generated surrogate key.
 * @param formKey     Consumer-defined identifier that groups drafts by screen/form type
 *                    (e.g. `"loan_application"`, `"client_registration"`). One pending draft
 *                    per (formKey, uniqueKey) pair is the intended invariant — consumers are
 *                    responsible for enforcing uniqueness via [DraftDao.deleteByFormKey] or
 *                    [DraftDao.deleteByUniqueKey] before inserting.
 * @param uniqueKey   Optional sub-identifier within a form type. `null` means
 *                    "the canonical/singleton draft for this form" (e.g. settings save,
 *                    Personal Alert form). Non-null distinguishes one of many drafts under
 *                    the same form type (e.g. Portfolio holding row, alert-per-coin) —
 *                    enables N concurrent independent drafts under one `formKey`.
 * @param payloadJson Serialized form payload (JSON). The concrete type is opaque to the
 *                    framework; consumers encode/decode via kotlinx.serialization.
 * @param status      Lifecycle state — see [DraftStatus].
 * @param createdAtMs Epoch millis when the draft was first saved.
 * @param updatedAtMs Epoch millis of the most recent status transition.
 * @param errorMessage Last failure reason for display in the resume UI (nullable).
