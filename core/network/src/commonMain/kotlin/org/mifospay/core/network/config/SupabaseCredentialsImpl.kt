 *
 * The concrete credentials object is emitted by SupabaseConfigConventionPlugin into the
 * module-scoped package configured in build.gradle.kts (`supabaseConfig.packageName =
 * "kpt.core.network.config"`), so we read the generated `url`/`anonKey` from there rather
 * than assuming a same-package object. `isConfigured` is derived locally from those values.
