/**
 * Store5 key for the LEDGER `notifications` store — one page of notifications
 * per authenticated client.
 *
 * The [clientId] doubles as the page key at the DAO layer
 * (`NotificationDao.replacePage(clientId, entities)`), so a logout-then-login
 * as a different client never disturbs the previous client's cached list.
 *
 * The Fineract `notifications/?isRead=true` endpoint does NOT take a
 * `clientId` path or query parameter (the list is scoped to the authenticated
 * session on the server side); the key is used purely for cache scoping, and
 * the mapper stamps the [clientId] into each persisted row at write time
 * (parity with `BeneficiaryKey`).
