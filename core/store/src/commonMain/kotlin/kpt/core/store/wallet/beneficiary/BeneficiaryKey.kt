/**
 * Store5 key for the LEDGER `beneficiary` store — one page of beneficiaries per
 * authenticated client.
 *
 * The [clientId] doubles as the page key at the DAO layer
 * (`BeneficiaryDao.replacePage(clientId, entities)`), so a logout-then-login as
 * a different client never disturbs the previous client's cached list.
 *
 * The Fineract `beneficiaryList()` endpoint does NOT take a `clientId` path or
 * query parameter (the list is scoped to the authenticated session on the
 * server); the key is used purely for cache scoping, and the mapper stamps
 * the [clientId] into each persisted row at write time.
