 * Store5 key for the LEDGER `savedCards` store — one page of saved payment
 * cards per client.
 *
 * The [clientId] doubles as the page key at the DAO layer
 * (`SavedCardDao.replacePage(clientId, entities)`) AND as the API path
 * parameter (`GET /datatables/saved_cards/{clientId}`), so per-client scoping
 * is enforced end-to-end.
