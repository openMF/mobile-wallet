 * Store5 key for the LEDGER `standingInstruction` store — one page of standing

 *
 * The [clientId] doubles as the page key at the DAO layer
 * (`StandingInstructionDao.replacePage(clientId, entities)`) AND as the API
 * query parameter (`GET /standinginstructions?clientId=<clientId>`), so
 * per-client scoping is enforced end-to-end.
