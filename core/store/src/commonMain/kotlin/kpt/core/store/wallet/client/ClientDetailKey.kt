 * Store5 key for the SINGLE-ROW-PER-KEY `clientDetail` store — one client-info
 * record per key.
 *
 * The [clientId] doubles as the primary key at the DAO layer
 * (`ClientDetailDao.upsert(entity(id = clientId))`), so a fresh fetch for
 * client A never disturbs cached detail rows for client B (which arises for
 * an admin operator + client-picker flow, and simply for a logout-then-login
 * as a different client on the same device).
