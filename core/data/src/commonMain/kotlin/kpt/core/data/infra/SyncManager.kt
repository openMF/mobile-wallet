/**
 * Observer surface for the in-flight sync state. NiA-port.
 *
 * Single binary signal — `isSyncing` — collected by composables that want to
 * surface "Refreshing…" indicators globally (typically the top app bar, the
 * home dashboard hero, etc.). `requestSync()` lets any caller kick off a
 * one-shot data sync without depending on `WorkScheduler` directly.
 *
 * Per-platform implementations live in the `sync/` module:
 *  - Android: WorkManager.getWorkInfosForUniqueWorkFlow(DATA_SYNC_WORK_NAME)
 *    mapped to Boolean
 *  - iOS/Desktop/Web: MutableStateFlow-backed stubs (v1 — real cross-platform
 *    scheduling is a follow-up).
