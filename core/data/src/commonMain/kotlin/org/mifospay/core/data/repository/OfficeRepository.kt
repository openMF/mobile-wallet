     * Room SoT, SWR revalidation once the TTL elapses).
     *
     * The office list is global reference data (not client-scoped), so the
     * store uses a value-less singleton key (`OfficesKey`) and there is exactly
     * one cache slot per app install. See `OfficesKey` KDoc for the rationale.
     *
     * @param scope the caller's [CoroutineScope] (typically `viewModelScope`)
     *   — Store5 subscribes its internal refresh trigger to this scope.
