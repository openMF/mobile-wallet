/**
 * Bridge extension: converts a single `kpt.core.base.store.screen.ScreenState<T>`
 * (emitted by Store5 `asScreenStream(...)`) into the fork's
 * `org.mifospay.core.common.ScreenState<T>`.
 *
 * Migration rationale (Phase-3 → Phase-4): the fork has kept its own sealed
 * interface [ForkScreenState] as the read-side model exposed on every
 * repository interface (see fork ScreenState.kt for the "mirror" contract).
 * With Store5 landing, impls now compose Flow<KptScreenState<T>> via
 * `store.asScreenStream(...).state` — which must be lifted back to the fork
 * ScreenState to satisfy the interface signature.
 *
 * Kotlin does NOT support nested-type access through a typealias, so we could
 * not collapse the two ScreenState types with a single-line alias in
 * core/common (callers use `ScreenState.Content(...)` etc. which resolves
 * against the class identifier, not through aliases). This bridge is the
 * minimally-invasive alternative — one file, ~10 lines of variant mapping,
 * used only where Store5 impls meet fork interfaces.
 *
 * NOTE on `Content`: we drop the KPT `freshnessSignal` field on the fork side
 * (the fork Content variant lacks it by design — the fork FreshnessIndicator
 * ships with the Phase-4 UI cutover). `fetchedAt` is preserved.
