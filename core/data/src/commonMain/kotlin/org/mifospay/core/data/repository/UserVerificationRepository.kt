/**
 * One-shot, time-bounded "user passed a passcode/biometric verification just
 * now" token. Backs the round-trip handshake between the internal passcode
 * gate and any caller that needs proof of recent authentication before
 * performing a sensitive action.
 *
 * Pattern:
 *  1. The internal passcode screen calls [recordVerification] from
 *     `MifosNavHost`'s `onAuthenticationSuccess` callback after the user
 *     successfully verifies.
 *  2. The calling feature (settings disable-biometrics, intra-bank transfer)
 *     observes the saved-state-handle round-trip boolean, then calls
 *     [consumeVerification] before the protected action. If the call returns
 *     `false`, the verification has expired (default 30 s window) and the
 *     user must re-verify.
 *
 * Single-use: [consumeVerification] both checks validity and clears the
 * token. A second call without an intervening [recordVerification] returns
 * `false`.
