/**
 * [UserVerificationRepository] implementation backed by
 * [TimeSource.Monotonic], held in-process for the lifetime of this singleton.
 *
 * A wall-clock-based implementation (e.g. `Clock.System.now()` + persisted
 * epoch-millis) is vulnerable to a **clock-rewind attack**: an attacker who
 * just entered the passcode can record the verification, background the app,
 * roll the device clock backward via Settings → Date & time, then return
 * later and have the elapsed-time check still succeed — extending their
 * verification window far past the intended 30 s. Monotonic clocks cannot
 * be moved by the user, so this vector is closed.
 *
 * **Trade-off:** the mark is held in a `private var`, not persisted, so a
 * process restart between [recordVerification] and [consumeVerification]
 * invalidates the token and the user must re-verify. For a 30 s window
 * that's acceptable defense-in-depth — and in practice every consumer
 * (settings disable-biometrics, intra-bank transfer auth gate) round-trips
 * through navigation in the same process.
