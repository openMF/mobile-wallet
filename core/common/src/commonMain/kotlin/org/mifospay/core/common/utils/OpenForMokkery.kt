/**
 * Annotation to mark a class as open for mocking during tests using Mokkery.
 *
 * When used with the Kotlin AllOpen plugin, any class annotated with this will be treated as `open`
 * during test compilation, allowing frameworks like Mokkery to create test doubles.
 *
 * ### Usage Example:
 * ```
 * @OpenForMokkery
 * class SomeService {
 *     fun doWork() = ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * In your build.gradle.kts:
 * ```
 * plugins {
 *     kotlin("plugin.allopen")
 * }
 *
 * allOpen {
 *     annotation("your.package.OpenForMokkery")
 * }
 * ```
