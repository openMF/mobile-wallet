/**
 * Unified UI state produced by fork repositories (and, once Phase 4 lands, by
 * `Store<Key, Output>.asScreenStream(...)`). Replaces the legacy
 * [DataState] sealed class as the single fork-wide read-side model.
 *
 * Mirrors the template's `kpt.core.base.store.screen.ScreenState` — SAME six
 * variants, SAME semantics — with two intentional simplifications for the
 * Phase-3 transitional window:
 *  - `Content.freshnessSignal` is OMITTED (the freshness engine + FreshnessBands
 *    machinery arrive with Phase 4's Store5 infra).
 *  - `NoNetwork.isCaptivePortal` defaults `false`; captive-portal detection
 *    ships with the cmp-network-monitor bridge in Phase 4.
 *
 * The six-branch surface (`Loading | Empty | NoNetwork | Unauthenticated |
 * Error | Content`) is fixed and MUST match the template so that Phase-4's
 * `ScreenContent` wrapper can consume fork ScreenStates unchanged.
 *
 * Post-migration NOTE: Kotlin does NOT support nested-type access through a
 * typealias, which prevents collapsing this into a single canonical type via
 * `typealias ScreenState<T> = kpt.core.base.store.screen.ScreenState<T>`
 * (callers use `ScreenState.Content(...)` etc. — that access resolves against
 * the class identifier, not through aliases). So we keep the fork sealed
 * interface as the canonical fork-side identifier and provide two bridges:
 *  - [toForkScreenState] converts `kpt.ScreenState<T>` → fork `ScreenState<T>`
 *    (used by Store5 impls to satisfy fork repository interface contracts).
 *  - [Flow<kpt.ScreenState<T>>.toForkScreenStateFlow] Flow-level convenience.
