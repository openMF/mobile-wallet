/**
 * Data-access object for the `wallet_linkable_accounts` LEDGER table.
 *
 * ## Access pattern (GOAL D13 — the LEDGER archetype)
 *
 * - **Reads** are reactive [Flow]s per client — [observeByClient].
 * - **Writes** are one-shot suspend fns; the store's `writer = { … }` lambda
 *   invokes exactly ONE of:
 *   - [replacePage] — the atomic default. Deletes-then-upserts under a single
 *     SQLite transaction so in-flight [observeByClient] collectors never see
 *     an empty page mid-write (S5-PAGE-ATOMIC anti-partial-read invariant).
 *   - [upsertAll] — append/merge only. Reserved for a future incremental
 *     writer if the account envelope grows a delta filter.
 *
 * ## Sort order
 *
 * Ascending by `accountType, accountNumber` — the manage-pocket link-accounts
 * sheet renders these in three tabs (LOAN / SAVINGS / SHARE); a stable
 * ordering by `accountType, accountNumber` keeps the fold to those tabs
 * deterministic across refresh cycles (mirrors `PocketDao` ordering).

     * On wasmJs the Store5 factory wraps this in
     * `daoFlow("wallet_linkable_accounts") { … }` — see `LinkableAccountStore.kt`
     * — so re-emission fires even when Room 3 alpha's async InvalidationTracker
     * fails.
