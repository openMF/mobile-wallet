/**
 * Data-access object for the `wallet_saving_account_details` SINGLE-ROW-PER-KEY table.
 *
 * ## Access pattern
 *
 * - **Reads** are reactive [Flow]s per account — [observeById].
 * - **Writes** are one-shot [upsert]s driven by the store's `writer = { … }` lambda.
 *   PK-on-[id] means an incoming fresh detail replaces the cached one atomically
 *   with no separate delete step; there is no "page window" to preserve because
 *   the payload is always a single record.
 *
 * ## Sort order
 *
 * N/A — [observeById] returns 0 or 1 row.

     *
     * The returned [Flow] re-emits on every write to
     * `wallet_saving_account_details`. On wasmJs the Store5 factory wraps this in
     * `daoFlow("wallet_saving_account_details") { … }` — see
     * `SavingAccountDetailStore.kt` — so re-emission fires even when Room 3 alpha's
     * async InvalidationTracker fails.
