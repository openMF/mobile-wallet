/**
 * Data-access object for the `wallet_offices` global-reference table.
 *
 * ## Access pattern (GOAL D13 — global LEDGER variant, singleton key)
 *
 * - **Reads** are reactive [Flow]s over the WHOLE table — [observeAll].
 * - **Writes** are one-shot suspend fns; the store's `writer = { … }` lambda
 *   invokes exactly ONE of:
 *   - [replaceAll] — the atomic default. Deletes-all + upserts-all under a
 *     single SQLite transaction so in-flight [observeAll] collectors never see
 *     an empty table mid-write (S5-PAGE-ATOMIC anti-partial-read invariant).
 *   - [upsertAll] — append/merge only. Reserved for a future incremental
 *     writer if the API grows a delta filter.
 *
 * The DAO does NOT expose a `deleteByClient` variant — the office list is
 * global (not client-scoped), so [deleteAll] IS the only sanctioned pruner.
 *
 * ## Sort order
 *
 * Alphabetical by [OfficeEntity.name] (case-insensitive) with `id ASC` as
 * tiebreaker. The FastMpayProcessor lookup (`find { it.id == qrData.officeId }`)
 * is O(N) at the caller anyway, so a name-sorted read matches the expected
 * pull-to-refresh list rendering order.

     * wasmJs the Store5 factory wraps this in `daoFlow("wallet_offices") { … }`
     * — see `OfficeStore.kt` — so re-emission fires even when Room 3 alpha's
     * async InvalidationTracker fails.
