/**
 * Persistent record of the last successful network fetch for a Store, keyed by
 * the framework's [kpt.core.base.store.FetchedAtRepository] convention
 * (`<feature>:<storeName>[:<key>]`).
 *
 * Backs the framework's [kpt.core.base.store.FetchedAtRepository] interface
 * via [kpt.core.data.repositoryImpl.RoomFetchedAtRepository]. The framework
 * uses this to render real "Updated 5m ago" timestamps in DataFreshnessIndicator
 * across ViewModel destruction, navigation, and app process restart.
 *
 * One row per Store. Tiny by design — eviction is not required.
