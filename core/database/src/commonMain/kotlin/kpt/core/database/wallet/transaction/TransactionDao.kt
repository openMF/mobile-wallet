/**
 * Data-access object for the `wallet_transactions` LEDGER table.
 *
 * ## Access pattern (GOAL D13 — the LEDGER archetype)
 *
 * - **Reads** are reactive [Flow]s per account — [observeByAccount].
 * - **Writes** are one-shot suspend fns; the store's `writer = { … }` lambda
 *   invokes exactly ONE of:
 *   - [replacePage] — the atomic default. Deletes-then-upserts under a single
 *     SQLite transaction so in-flight [observeByAccount] collectors never see
 *     an empty page mid-write (S5-PAGE-ATOMIC anti-partial-read invariant).
 *   - [upsertAll] — append/merge only. Sanctioned for future incremental delta
 *     fetches (see [latestDateForAccount] below): once Fineract exposes a
 *     `?since=<ms>` transactions filter, the store's fetcher can pull only the
 *     new tail and its writer switches to `upsertAll(delta)` — no server-truth
 *     re-delete needed. Today the API returns the full account list, so the
 *     writer stays on [replacePage].
 *
 * ## Delta cursor
 *
 * [latestDateForAccount] returns the newest cached `dateEpochMs` for a given
 * `accountId` (or `null` when the page is empty). This is the SINCE cursor the
 * store's fetcher reads *before* calling the network — it lets the fetcher choose
 * "full pull" (cold cache) vs "delta" (warm cache) even while today's API only
 * supports the former. Wiring the cursor now keeps the store body stable for the
 * eventual server-side `?since=` upgrade.
 *
 * ## Sort order
 *
 * Newest-first on `dateEpochMs` (nulls last), tiebreaker on `transactionId`.
 * Matches the existing UI's chronological rendering in `HistoryScreen`.
