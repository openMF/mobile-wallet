/**
 * Data-access object for the `wallet_beneficiaries` LEDGER table.
 *
 * ## Access pattern (GOAL D13 — the LEDGER archetype)
 *
 * - **Reads** are reactive [Flow]s per client — [observeByClient].
 * - **Writes** are one-shot suspend fns; the store's `writer = { … }` lambda
 *   invokes exactly ONE of:
 *   - [replacePage] — the atomic default. Deletes-then-upserts under a single
 *     SQLite transaction so in-flight [observeByClient] collectors never see
 *     an empty page mid-write (S5-PAGE-ATOMIC anti-partial-read invariant).
 *   - [upsertAll] — append/merge only. Reserved for a future incremental
 *     writer if the API grows a delta filter.
 *
 * ## Sort order
 *
 * Alphabetical by [BeneficiaryEntity.name] (case-insensitive) — matches the
 * existing UI's list-view alphabetic sort in `BeneficiaryListScreen`.

     * The returned [Flow] re-emits on every write to `wallet_beneficiaries`. On
     * wasmJs the Store5 factory wraps this in `daoFlow("wallet_beneficiaries") { … }`
     * — see `BeneficiaryStore.kt` — so re-emission fires even when Room 3 alpha's
     * async InvalidationTracker fails.
