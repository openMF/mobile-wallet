/**
 * Entity ↔ domain mapper for the `wallet_standing_instructions` table.
 *
 * `StandingInstruction` is a deeply nested `@Serializable` payload (five
 * distinct nested types plus a `List<Int>` for `recurrenceOnMonthDay`). The
 * whole payload is persisted as one JSON string column ([StandingInstructionEntity.payloadJson]);
 * only [StandingInstructionEntity.id] / `clientId` / [StandingInstructionEntity.name] /
 * `fetchedAtEpochMs` are pulled out as first-class columns for keyable /
 * queryable access. See [StandingInstructionEntity]'s KDoc for the rationale
 * (whole-payload read model, no per-field query need).
 *
 * The [Json] instance is `ignoreUnknownKeys = true` so an evolving server DTO
 * doesn't crash a cached row on read-back.

 * Convert a fetched domain [StandingInstruction] into a persistable row.
 *
 * The Fineract `getAllStandingInstructions(clientId)` endpoint scopes the list
 * to a specific client, so the caller passes the owning [clientId] from the
 * store key (parity with the `Beneficiary` mapper).
 *
 * Rows without a server id (only possible during a create round-trip; the
 * response echo carries an id) are coalesced to `id = 0L` defensively — in
 * practice, the store's writer only persists server-returned lists, so this
 * fallback never fires.
 *
 * @param clientId owning client id — the store's page key.
 * @param fetchedAtEpochMs local cache-write timestamp — the store's writer
 *   passes `Clock.System.now().toEpochMilliseconds()` here.
