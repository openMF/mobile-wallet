/**
 * Data-access object for the `wallet_transfer_details` SINGLE-ROW-PER-KEY table.
 *
 * ## Access pattern
 *
 * - **Reads** are reactive [Flow]s per transfer — [observeById].
 * - **Writes** are one-shot [upsert]s driven by the store's `writer = { … }` lambda.
 *   PK-on-`transferId` means an incoming fresh detail replaces the cached one
 *   atomically with no separate delete step; there is no "page window" to preserve
 *   because the payload is always a single record.
 *
 * Mirrors `SavingAccountDetailDao`.
 *
 * ## Sort order
 *
 * N/A — [observeById] returns 0 or 1 row.

     *
     * The returned [Flow] re-emits on every write to `wallet_transfer_details`. On
     * wasmJs the Store5 factory wraps this in
     * `daoFlow("wallet_transfer_details") { … }` — see `TransferDetailStore.kt` — so
     * re-emission fires even when Room 3 alpha's async InvalidationTracker fails.
