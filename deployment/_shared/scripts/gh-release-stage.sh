#
# Apply GitHub Release `prerelease` + `latest` flags per the direct-distribution
# promotion ladder (Stage 1 RC → Stage 2 Beta → Stage 3 Production). Shared by
# every desktop direct-distribution script that uploads to GH Releases:
#   - deployment/desktop/macos-dmg-unsigned/script.sh   (kept for legacy parity)
#   - deployment/desktop/windows-exe/script.sh
#   - deployment/desktop/msi-signed/script.sh
#   - deployment/desktop/linux-deb/script.sh
# (The Ruby Fastlane equivalent lives inline in dmg-notarized/lane.rb as
# `_set_release_stage_flags`.)
#
# Usage:
#   bash deployment/_shared/scripts/gh-release-stage.sh <tag> <stage>
# Where <stage> ∈ {prerelease, beta, stable}.
#
# Mapping:
#   prerelease → prerelease: true,  latest: false   (Stage 1)
#   beta       → prerelease: false, latest: false   (Stage 2)
#   stable     → prerelease: false, latest: true    (Stage 3)
#
# No-op without GH_TOKEN — `gh release edit` requires auth.
