/**
 * Single data-sync worker. Implements [Synchronizer] so its two [Syncable]
 * collaborators ([CurrencyRepository], [MacroIndicatorsRepository]) can read +
 * write [ChangeListVersions] through `this` without an extra abstraction.
 *
 * **No `getAll<Syncable>()`** — the two repos are constructor-injected as named interfaces. Adding a third
 * Syncable (e.g. FRED interest rates) requires editing this class signature +
 * the [SyncModule] binding — not a runtime discovery.
 *
 * The `awaitAll` shape means partial failure is full failure — if one repo
 * throws, the entire sync is `Result.retry()`. This matches NiA's surface
 * (single `Flow<Boolean>` to observers) and is what the template's home
 * dashboard expects.
