/**
 * Koin-injectable façade over worker-kmp's `WorkManager` — the **single API
 * surface** every consumer module (feature/loans, feature/bills, …) uses to
 * schedule data sync + notifications.
 *
 * Consumers depend on the `sync` module to get this interface but NEVER
 * import `io.github.mobilebytelabs.worker.*` directly. That decoupling is the
 * point: when worker-kmp's `WorkManager` API evolves, only `DefaultWorkScheduler`
 * (the impl) changes — call sites stay stable.
 *
 * Example (cross-module use from `feature/loans`):
 * ```kotlin
 * class LoanReminderUseCase(private val scheduler: WorkScheduler) {
 *     fun scheduleDueDateReminder(loan: Loan) {
 *         scheduler.scheduleNotification(
 *             NotificationContent("Loan payment due", "Loan #${loan.id}"),
 *             delay = (loan.dueAt - now()) - 1.days,
 *             mode = WorkMode.Foreground,
 *         )
 *     }
 *     fun refreshLoans() = scheduler.enqueueDataSync(mode = WorkMode.Background)
 * }
 * ```
