# deployment-manifest-validate.sh — validate the deploy-target ownership split (E1 / D-1).
#
# After the white-label separation (epic pure-white-label-store5-network), deploy-target state
# is split across TWO files with distinct owners:
#
#   • deployment/DEPLOYMENT_MANIFEST.yaml   — TEMPLATE CATALOG: which targets EXIST (owner: template).
#   • app-profile/deploy-targets.yaml       — FORK STATE: which of those a fork ENABLES + at what
#                                             tier / confirm gate (owner: fork).
#
# This validator asserts the two are coherent:
#   V1  every canonical_name in app-profile/deploy-targets.yaml exists in the template catalog
#       (a fork can't enable a target the template doesn't ship).
#   V2  every enabled fork target declares a tier ∈ {1,2}.
#   V3  the promotion log is FRAMEWORK-level (deployment-layer/deploy-state/) — NOT in this source repo (E1/D-4).
#
# Pure bash + grep — no Gradle, no network, no YAML lib (line-oriented reads only).
# Usage: bash scripts/deployment-manifest-validate.sh   # exit 0 clean, exit 1 on any violation
