#
# Creates + protects the GitHub Environments the multi-platform release pipeline
# binds to, so that store/distribution stages PAUSE for a manual "Approve and
# deploy" before publishing. Run this once per repo that DISPATCHES releases.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   The publish-* reusable workflows declare `environment: <name>` on every
#   store stage (e.g. publish-android-kmp/release.yaml → `android-play-internal`).
#   GitHub resolves that environment against the REPO WHERE THE RUN EXECUTES.
#   If the environment is absent OR has no required-reviewer rule there, GitHub
#   runs the job immediately — NO approval prompt. (Observed empirically: a run
#   on openMF/kmp-project-template went straight to the Play upload and failed,
#   `approvals: []`, because openMF's `android-play-internal` had 0 reviewers.)
#   Configuring required reviewers here is what turns the stage into a gate.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - gh CLI installed and authenticated (gh auth login)
#   - You MUST have ADMIN on the target repo (environment protection rules are
#     an admin-only API — write/maintain is NOT enough; you'll get HTTP 403
#     "Must have admin rights to Repository.").
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/configure-release-environments.sh --repo owner/repo --reviewer-team <org>/<slug>
#   bash scripts/configure-release-environments.sh --repo owner/repo --reviewer <login-or-id>
#   bash scripts/configure-release-environments.sh --repo openMF/kmp-project-template --reviewer-team openMF/mobile-release-approvers
#   bash scripts/configure-release-environments.sh --repo owner/repo --reviewer 5724482 --dry-run
#   bash scripts/configure-release-environments.sh --repo owner/repo --reviewer-team openMF/mobile-release-approvers --only android,ios
#   bash scripts/configure-release-environments.sh --repo owner/repo --reviewer-team openMF/mobile --reviewer me   # team + a fallback individual
#
# Flags:
#   --repo owner/repo        Target repo (REQUIRED). Where releases are dispatched.
#   --reviewer-team <org>/<slug>
#                            Required-reviewer TEAM added to every gated environment.
#                            RECOMMENDED over --reviewer: any member of the team can
#                            approve, so there is no single-approver bottleneck and the
#                            gate survives personnel changes (resilient over time). The
#                            team needs >=write access on the target repo.
#   --reviewer <id|login>    Required-reviewer USER added to every gated environment.
#                            Accepts a numeric user id, a @login, or the literal `me`
#                            (resolves to the authenticated user). The user needs >=write
#                            access on the target repo.
#
#                            At least one of --reviewer-team / --reviewer is REQUIRED;
#                            both may be given (a team plus a named fallback reviewer).
#                            Prefer --reviewer-team for shared/org repos.
#   --only <list>            Comma-separated platform subset to gate:
#                            android,ios,mac,desktop,web (default: all).
#   --desktop-target <slug>  Desktop artifact slug used in env names
#                            `desktop-<slug>-{prerelease,beta,stable}`
#                            (default: linux-deb). Repeatable via comma list.
#   --web-host <slug>        Web host slug used in env names
#                            `web-<slug>-{preview,staging,production}`
#                            (default: gh-pages). Repeatable via comma list.
#   --wait-prod <minutes>    Optional wait timer (minutes) on the top rung
#                            (production / app-store / stable) (default: 0).
#   --production-only        Gate ONLY the external / production-facing stages
#                            (closed/beta/production, testflight-external, app-store,
#                            web staging/production, desktop beta/stable). Leaves the
#                            internal / firebase / preview / prerelease TEST channels
#                            ungated so routine test builds don't need an approval
#                            click. RECOMMENDED for most teams.
#   --dry-run                Print what would change; make no API calls.
#
# Firebase note: `android-firebase` / `ios-firebase` (App Distribution) ARE gated by
# default — Stage 0 is the FIRST deploy point, so gating it makes EVERY rung require an
# approval click. The publish-* ladder workflows already declare
# `environment: <platform>-firebase` on the Stage-0 job, so setting these reviewers is
# all that's needed. Pass --production-only to leave Firebase (and the other
# internal/preview/prerelease TEST channels) ungated.
#
# Team vs individual: prefer --reviewer-team for shared/org repos. A team reviewer
# means any team member can approve (no single point of failure), the gate keeps
# working across personnel changes, and — because THIS script sets the team on the
# environment — the config never drifts from what the org intends (vs. adding the
# team by hand after a --reviewer run, which leaves script + environment out of sync).
#
# Idempotent: re-running re-applies the same reviewer set (PUT replaces config).
