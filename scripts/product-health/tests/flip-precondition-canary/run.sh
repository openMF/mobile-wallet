# run.sh — RED/GREEN canary for customization-surface.sh `require-flip-preconditions` (the E0/T1 atomic
# self-guard that scripts/white-label/sync-dirs.sh calls before any sync).
#
# Heals the 2026-08-10 defect: og-images were reclassified `owner: generated` in customization-surface.yaml
# but the guard still hard-asserted `og-images/01_home.png == fork`, so the guard failed → sync-dirs.sh
# HALTed on EVERY tree (incl. the template itself). This canary locks guard-expectation ↔ YAML-classification
# consistency so the two can never drift again.
#
#   GREEN: the REAL customization-surface.yaml → require-flip-preconditions exit 0.
#   RED:   a fixture generated FROM the real YAML with the og-images owner flipped back to `fork`
#          (the pre-reclassification / stale state) → the guard (expects `generated`) fires → exit 1.
#          Generated at runtime so it never drifts from the real contract's shape.
